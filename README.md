# M5-PyBer-with-Matplotlib
## Overview
- Using the information provided by V. Isualize we will clean and analyze the total weekly fare for each city type by using python and PyBer. The point of this analysis is to help V. Isualize in the future decision making process. 
## Results

- As we can see from the data collected the rural area may be making less money than the urban area but there more efficient and make an a average of 55 dollars per driver.
- As for the urban areas they may have collected more business but each driver isnt making much profit compared to the other areas provided in this study.

- The information from are study is then translated into a line graph
## Summary 
= With the information we have, we can assume there is an operation issue with the urban areas. Why we think this is because there are more drivers to help with the increased business but even though there are more drivers, they aren't pulling in as much cash individually. For potential fixes, we would have to consider more research about how the different areas run their business. Also at the same time, we can assume it is an area issue. Urban areas are harder to get around due to more people causing more traffic. As for the other areas, it is less crowded. This could be a reason for the drivers not pulling in as much money as the other areas.  In conclusion, that's where I feel its an operations issue. The operations should reflect the area where the service is to be provided for a company to operate smoothly.
